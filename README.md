# Zyenyo
This is a simple Discord bot I am creating for fun.


# Running the BOT

The bot is programmed to run as a module, hence you'll need to use the `-m` flag to run it with python.

## On Windows

```ps
$env:BOT_TOKEN='BAR'; python -m ZyenyoBot
```

## On Linux

```bash
BOT_TOKEN="BAR" python -m ZyenyoBot
```


## Notes for Sei-chan

I detail a bunch of smaller things

FIXME(BETTER WAY): There's a better way to do this, in python, as adviced by many programmers. Consider researching on how to do this.
    (I'll also be providing some helpful stuff to refer to so don't worry too much.)

FIXME(DO NOT DO THIS): Do not do [Whatever it is I mentioned]. Typically bad usage of something or the other. 

FIXME(SOME COMMENTS PLEASE): Add a comment or two, it'll be helpful in the long run. 

FIXME(BREAK ME UP): Don't actually break up with someone, you need to just break it up into smaller functions.
