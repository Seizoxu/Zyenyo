Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one doesn’t get enough sleep, one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. Studies have shown that after staying awake for 24 hours, one’s ability to do simple math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as driving drunk. Moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be induced by lack of sleep. As much as people try to do without enough sleep, it is a wonder more crazy things don’t happen in this world.
