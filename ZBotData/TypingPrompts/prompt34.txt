Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. One does not simply accept a Chromebook. No, sir. That is left for those who have went through every other possible option, including illicit methods. That is an option reserved for those who truly suffer from some unreal combination of bad luck. Using a Chromebook should not be seen as a blessing, no. If a poor village is presented with hardware so unequivocally, indubitably, heck, indescribably heart-wreching, stomach-churning, and dysentery-inducing, the only reasonable choice is to refuse without a second thought. No, I'm mistaken. That's one of the most kind things that one can possibly do to a Chromebook. "Normal" behavior would be immediately setting fire to the supply, throwing it into a concentrated explosion with an explosive power hundreds of times larger than the Tsar Bomba, and set it on a collision course towards the nearest Black hole. From there, the attached camera would send us a feed of it slowly spiralling around the Black hole, being spaghettified and torn apart in the process. From this, we somehow advance in our physics studies, extract the absorbed matter from the Black hole, spit on it, and slap it into Mr. Smiley-face Sundar Pichai, or whichever idiot decided that Chromebooks would somehow be of use to the world. No, my friends. Chromebooks are of no use to this world. They are number 1 on the list of things for humanity to exterminate, just ahead of cockroaches. I've had enough of these machines, and it's been a long night. Goodnight.
