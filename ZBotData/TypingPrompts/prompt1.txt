Hah, you think you can beat me, the Potlet on a spinner? You're mistaken. Largely mistaken. I practice spinners every day. How, you say? Well, I make milk in the morning. I add some sugar. On good days I add matcha, on normal days I add chocolate syrup. I take my spoon and start spinning 400 rpm. That's the first thing in the morning okay? Then in the afternoon I make tea okay? I add sugar. And then I spin 400 rpm again. Then at night, I start feeling hungry. I make some warm milk. And then add sugar. And then, I spin. 400 rpm. As long as you guys don't stir your milk and tea, you don't stand a chance outspinning me haha.
